# Current Backup Files

This directory contains recent general backups of docker-compose.yml that are not specifically categorized under email configurations or historical versions.

## Purpose

These backups serve as:
- Recent working configurations
- Safety net before major changes  
- Quick restore points for recent versions

## Files

Files in this directory follow the standard naming convention and represent configurations that were working at the time of backup.

## Recommendation

For more specific configurations (especially email-related), check the `email-configs/` directory which contains more targeted and well-documented backup versions.
