## Subdirectories

### `original/`
- Early versions of docker-compose files
- Basic configurations before major feature additions

### `port-configs/`  
- Versions with port mapping changes
- Different port configurations for services

### `temp-configs/`

## Purpose

These files are kept for:
- Historical reference

## Usage

These files can be used as reference or for emergency rollback situations, but are generally superseded by newer configurations in the `email-configs/` directory.
