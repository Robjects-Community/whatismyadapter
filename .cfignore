# Cloudflare Ignore File
# This file prevents Cloudflare Workers/Pages from attempting to deploy
# files that are not compatible with the platform.
#
# NOTE: This entire repository is incompatible with Cloudflare Workers
# because it's a PHP CakePHP application. See DEPLOYMENT.md for proper
# deployment instructions.

# Ignore everything - this is a PHP application, not a Worker
*

# If you want to deploy static docs to Cloudflare Pages in the future,
# you could create a separate /docs-static folder and exclude it above:
# !docs-static/**
