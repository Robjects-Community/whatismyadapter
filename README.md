## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) (only requirement on your host machine)
- Git

### Installation

#### Quick Run - Existing Installation

Code below will install all necessary dependencies and set up the development environment.
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Robjects-Community/WhatIsMyAdaptor.git
cd WhatIsMyAdaptor

# Run the setup script
./setup_dev_env.sh
```

before finishing the script, you should be prompted to type the letter **(w/b/r/m/c)** corresponding to your preferred options for the development environment setup, options include:

  - Wipe data: letter 'W'
  - Rebuild containers: letter 'B'
  - Restart services: letter 'R'
  - Run migrations: letter 'M'
  - Continue with the current setup: letter 'C'


> Note:
> This quick start guide assumes that you have already run `docker-compose up -d` or `docker compose up -d` to start the containers and that docker compose is set up correctly.


#### Quick Run - Fresh Installation

1) Install docker
2) Clone repo
3) cd into folder
4) `docker-compose up -d` or `docker compose up -d`
5) Wait for the containers to be fully up and running
6) Then run setup_dev_env.sh
7) Run the aliases script and feel free to use the scripts going forward! :)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Robjects-Community/WhatIsMyAdaptor.git
cd WhatIsMyAdaptor

# Test Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Check if the containers are running
docker-compose ps
```


ðŸŽ‰ **That's it!** Your development environment is ready:

- **Main Site**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- **Admin Panel**: [http://localhost:8080/admin](http://localhost:8080/admin)
  - **Login**: `admin@test.com` / `password`

### Additional Services

- **phpMyAdmin**: [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) (root/password)
- **Mailpit**: [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) (email testing)
- **Redis Commander**: [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084) (root/password)
- **Jenkins**: [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) (start with `./setup_dev_env.sh --jenkins`)

## Managing the Application

## Using `manage.sh`

`manage.sh` is a script that can be used that simplifies common tasks needed to manage the application.

This contains predefined commands for common tasks. Use `./manage.sh <command>` to run a command (or just `./manage.sh` to see a list of available commands).

## Using script aliases from `setup_dev_aliases.sh`

Ensure you have sourced the `setup_dev_aliases.sh`
and have added the necessary details needed in your specific .*rc file. Then run:
```bash
source ./setup_dev_aliases.sh
```
You should now be able to use the defined aliases in your terminal session, look at 'dev_aliases.txt' for more information on what aliases are available.

### Useful Aliases
Here are the following aliases that would help manage the project:

- `willow_shell`: Run cake in the main project container
- `willowcms_shell`: Get a bash shell in the main project container (alias for `willow_shell`)

### CakePHP Command Aliases
Here are some useful aliases for running CakePHP commands:

```bash
willow_shell
```


> Note: Running `willow_shell` is the equivalent as running `bin/cake` inside the container. Therefore, you can use `willow_shell` to run any cakephp command without having to enter `bin/cake` before every command.

### Using the Project Container

1) Get into the main project container using `docker-compose exec [NAME_OF_YOUR_CONTAINER] /bin/bash` (or alias `willowcms_shell` after setting up aliases)
2) Once in the container, run `bin/cake migrations migrate` to migrate the DB just like you would in a normal cakephp setup
3) Terminal in the container and run `bin/cake migrations seed` to seed the DB


## Extra Notes

> Note: The project doesn't contain any initial seed data as all seeding is already managed through commands in the `manage.sh` scripts. You will need to create your own seed files in the `config/Seeds` directory if you plan on using the seeding functionality according to the CakePHP documentation.

### Special Thanks
I want to give a huge shoutout to **Matthew** for his invaluable GitHub contributions to the base project.

Developers like him make open-source projects thrive. He has been instrumental in helping me set up this project and navigate the complexities of Docker and CakePHP. Projects like these are exactly why I advocate great open-source and I plan on featuring him in an upcoming video.

Future project video coming soon! - Mike
