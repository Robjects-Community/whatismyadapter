### üè• health-check.sh
**Comprehensive health check with status reporting and CI/CD integration**

Performs detailed health checks on all services with multiple output formats for both human operators and automated systems.

```bash
# Check all services with table output
./scripts/health-check.sh

# JSON output for CI/CD integration
./scripts/health-check.sh --format=json

# Check specific service only
./scripts/health-check.sh --service=willowcms

## Common Usage Examples

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Morning startup
./scripts/health-check.sh --format=table

# If issues found, restart environment
./scripts/restart-environment.sh --soft

# Before major changes, create backup
./scripts/backup-and-reset.sh --backup
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Health check in pipeline
./scripts/health-check.sh --format=json --timeout=30
EXIT_CODE=$?

if [ $EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "Services unhealthy, attempting restart..."
  ./scripts/restart-environment.sh --force --no-verify
fi
```

### Disaster Recovery
```bash
# Create emergency backup
./scripts/backup-and-reset.sh --backup --backup-dir=/external/backups

# Full environment reset and restore
./scripts/backup-and-reset.sh --reset --force
./scripts/backup-and-reset.sh --restore --restore-from=/external/backups/backup_2024-01-15_14-30-25
```

### Development Environment Reset
```bash
# Clean reset for testing
./scripts/backup-and-reset.sh --backup-reset --no-volumes --force

# Quick restart after reset
./scripts/restart-environment.sh --force
```

### Log Files
All scripts generate detailed logs in the `logs/` directory:
- Timestamps for all operations
- Color-coded console output
- Persistent file logging
- Error tracking and debugging information

## Environment Requirements

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Bash shell (macOS/Linux)
- Standard Unix utilities (curl, nc, tar, gzip)
- Write permissions in project directory

### Supported Services
- **willowcms** - Main application container
- **mysql** - Database server
- **redis** - Cache and session storage
- **phpmyadmin** - Database management UI
- **mailpit** - Email testing server
- **redis-commander** - Redis management UI
- **jenkins** - CI/CD server (optional)

## Security Considerations

### Backup Security
- Backups contain sensitive data including database dumps
- Environment files contain API keys and passwords
- Store backups in secure, encrypted locations
- Regularly rotate backup encryption keys
- Implement backup retention policies

### Script Permissions
```bash
# Set appropriate permissions
chmod 750 scripts/*.sh          # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Other: ---
chown -R $USER:docker scripts/   # Ensure proper ownership
```

### Production Usage
- Always test scripts in development first
- Use `--force` flag carefully in production
- Implement proper backup verification
- Monitor log files for security issues
- Use separate backup storage for production

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

**Docker Not Running:**
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker info

# Start Docker if needed (macOS)
open -a Docker
```

**Backup Restoration Fails:**
```bash
# Check backup integrity
./scripts/backup-and-reset.sh --verify --restore-from=./backups/backup_2024-01-15_14-30-25

# Check log files
tail -f logs/backup-and-reset.log
```

**Services Won't Start:**
```bash
# Check specific service logs
docker-compose logs willowcms
docker-compose logs mysql

# Try hard reset
./scripts/restart-environment.sh --hard --force
```

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging for detailed troubleshooting:
```bash
./scripts/health-check.sh --verbose
./scripts/restart-environment.sh --no-verify  # Skip verification for speed
```

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Docker Compose Integration
These scripts work alongside existing Docker Compose workflows:
```bash
# Traditional approach
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d

# Enhanced approach with verification
./scripts/restart-environment.sh --soft
```

### CakePHP Development
Compatible with existing CakePHP development tools referenced in the user's rules:
- Works with existing docker-compose.yml configuration
- Respects CakePHP 5.x directory structure
- Integrates with MySQL database setup
- Supports development workflow with queue workers

### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Health Check
  run: ./scripts/health-check.sh --format=json --timeout=60
  
- name: Backup Before Deploy
  run: ./scripts/backup-and-reset.sh --backup --backup-dir=/deploy/backups
  
- name: Deploy and Verify
  run: |
    ./scripts/restart-environment.sh --force
    ./scripts/health-check.sh --timeout=120
```

## Support and Maintenance

### Script Updates
Scripts are versioned and can be updated independently:
- Check version: `grep "version=" scripts/backup-and-reset.sh`
- Update safely by backing up current versions
- Test updates in development environment first

### Monitoring
Regular maintenance tasks:
- Review log files weekly
- Clean old backups monthly  
- Verify backup integrity quarterly
- Update script documentation as needed

### Contributing
When modifying scripts:
1. Test all changes thoroughly
2. Update help text and documentation
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Follow existing error handling patterns
5. Update version numbers appropriately
