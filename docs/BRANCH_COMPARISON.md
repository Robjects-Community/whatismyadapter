# Branch Comparison: main-clean vs portainer-stack

**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Current Branch:** portainer-stack  
**Comparison Branch:** main-clean

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **RESULT:** Both branches are functionally identical for development purposes.

- **`./run_dev_env.sh`**: Byte-for-byte identical
- **Core application code** (`app/src/`): Only 1 minor Docker compatibility improvement
- **Directory structure**: Both use `./app/` (with legacy `./cakephp/` support)
- **Main difference**: portainer-stack is a cleaner version with ~180K lines of debug logs and artifacts removed

---

## Directory Structure

### Both Branches Use: `./app/`

```
willow/
├── app/                    # Main application directory
│   ├── bin/               # Console commands
│   ├── config/            # Configuration files
│   ├── plugins/           # Theme plugins
│   ├── src/               # Core application code
│   ├── templates/         # View templates
│   ├── tests/             # Unit tests
│   ├── vendor/            # Composer dependencies
│   └── webroot/           # Public web assets
└── ...
```

**Legacy Support:** Both branches support `./cakephp/` directory for backward compatibility during repository reorganization.

## `./run_dev_env.sh` Script Comparison

### Status: ✅ **IDENTICAL**

The scripts are byte-for-byte identical. Both include:

#### Features
- ✅ Automatic directory structure detection (`app/` or `cakephp/`)
- ✅ Deployment state detection and cleanup
- ✅ Fresh development setup (`--fresh-dev`)
- ✅ Force clean development (`--force-clean-dev`)
- ✅ Interactive and non-interactive modes
- ✅ All operation modes: wipe, rebuild, restart, migrate
- ✅ Color output and error handling
- ✅ Docker requirements checking
- ✅ MySQL wait logic
- ✅ Composer dependency installation
- ✅ Database migration support
- ✅ Default user creation
- ✅ i18n data loading option
- ✅ Jenkins service option

#### Command Line Options

```bash
-h, --help              # Show help message
-j, --jenkins           # Include Jenkins service
-i, --i18n              # Load internationalization data
-n, --no-interactive    # Skip interactive prompts
-w, --wipe              # Wipe Docker containers and volumes
-b, --rebuild           # Rebuild Docker containers from scratch
-r, --restart           # Restart Docker containers
-m, --migrate           # Run database migrations only
-c, --continue          # Continue with normal startup
--fresh-dev             # Complete fresh development setup
--force-clean-dev       # Force clean development (removes all deployment configs)
--skip-cleanup          # Skip deployment state cleanup checks
```

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Normal startup
./run_dev_env.sh

# Fresh development setup
./run_dev_env.sh --fresh-dev

# Rebuild without prompts
./run_dev_env.sh --rebuild --no-interactive

# Force clean development
./run_dev_env.sh --force-clean-dev

# With Jenkins and i18n
./run_dev_env.sh -j -i
```

## Application Code Changes

### Statistics

**Overall Changes:** 499 files changed, 239 insertions, 181,875 deletions

### Core Application (`app/src/`)

**Status:** ✅ **NEARLY IDENTICAL** - Only 1 file changed

#### Modified File: `app/src/Console/Installer.php`

**Changes:**
- Improved Docker compatibility for chmod operations
- Suppresses permission errors in containers
- Better warning messages for permission issues
- **Impact:** Non-breaking, backward compatible change

**Diff:**
```php
// Before (main-clean)
$res = chmod($path, $worldWritable);
if ($res) {
    $io->write('Permissions set on ' . $path);
} else {
    $io->write('Failed to set permissions on ' . $path);
}

// After (portainer-stack)
$res = @chmod($path, $worldWritable);
if ($res) {
    $io->write('Permissions set on ' . $path);
} else {
    $io->write('<comment>Warning: Unable to set permissions on ' . $path . ' (may be handled by container/host)</comment>');
}
```

**Rationale:** In Docker environments, file permissions are often managed by the container or host system. This change prevents unnecessary errors while still warning about permission issues.

### 2. Logs

**main-clean:**
- Contains debug logs (`app/logs/debug.log`)
- Contains error logs (`app/logs/error.log`)
- Contains database logs
- Log checksums present

**portainer-stack:**
- Logs cleaned up
- Fresh log structure
- No committed log files
- Ready for production deployment

### 3. Plugins

## Recommendations

### For Development

Both branches work identically for development purposes:

```bash
# Either branch works the same way
git checkout main-clean
./run_dev_env.sh

# Or
git checkout portainer-stack
./run_dev_env.sh
```

### For Production

**Recommended:** `portainer-stack`

Reasons:
1. **Cleaner codebase** - No development artifacts
2. **Smaller footprint** - ~180K fewer lines
3. **Better Docker compatibility** - chmod improvements
4. **Production-ready** - Logs and debug files removed
5. **Easier to deploy** - Less clutter

### Migration Path

If currently on `main-clean`:

```bash
# Switch to portainer-stack
git checkout portainer-stack

# Run fresh development setup
./run_dev_env.sh --fresh-dev

# Verify everything works
./manage.sh
```

No data loss - volumes are preserved across branch switches.
