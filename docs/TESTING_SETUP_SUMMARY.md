---

## üöÄ Quick Start (Do This Now!)

### Step 1: Check Your Starting Point
```bash
cd /Volumes/1TB_DAVINCI/docker/willow
./tools/testing/progress.sh
```

**Expected output:**
```
Models: 0/33 (0%)
Controllers: 0/68 (0%)
Overall Progress: 0/128 (0%)
```

### Step 2: Start Docker Environment
```bash
./run_dev_env.sh
```

### Step 3: Preview Test Generation
```bash
./tools/testing/generate-all-tests.sh --models --dry-run
```

This shows what tests will be created without actually creating them.

### Step 4: Generate Your First Batch of Tests
```bash
# Generate tests for all models
./tools/testing/generate-all-tests.sh --models
```

**This creates:**
- 33 test files in `app/tests/TestCase/Model/Table/`
- Fixture files in `app/tests/Fixture/`
- Basic test structure for each model

### Step 5: Start Testing Your First Model
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start watch mode
./tools/testing/continuous-test.sh --model Users --watch

# Terminal 2: Edit the test
code app/tests/TestCase/Model/Table/UsersTableTest.php
```

### Step 6: Generate Coverage Report
```bash
./tools/testing/continuous-test.sh --model Users --coverage
open app/tmp/coverage/index.html
```

### Step 7: Track Progress
```bash
./tools/testing/progress.sh
```

**Expected after first test:**
```
Models: 1/33 (3%)
Overall Progress: 1/128 (1%)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è MCP Server Integration

Your testing workflow integrates with **6 MCP servers** for maximum efficiency:

### 1. **GitHub MCP** (Track Progress)
```bash
# Create milestone
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/milestones -f title="Complete Test Suite"

# Create issue for each component
gh issue create --title "Test UsersTable" --label testing

# Track progress
gh issue list --label testing --state open

# Close issues with PRs
gh pr create --title "Add UsersTable tests" --body "Closes #123"
```

### 2. **Sequential Thinking MCP** (Plan Tests)
Use when planning complex test scenarios:
- Break down test cases into steps
- Design integration test workflows
- Debug failing tests
- Optimize test performance

### 3. **Knowledge Graph MCP** (Map Relationships)
Track which tests cover which components:
```javascript
// Create entities for models/tests
create_entities([{
  name: "UsersTable",
  entityType: "Model",
  observations: ["Coverage: 92%", "Critical: Yes"]
}])

// Link relationships
create_relations([{
  from: "UsersTable",
  to: "UsersTableTest",
  relationType: "tested_by"
}])

// Query progress
search_nodes({ query: "test coverage" })
```

### 4. **Fetch MCP** (Access Docs)
```bash
# Get CakePHP testing docs
fetch("https://book.cakephp.org/5/en/development/testing.html")

# Get PHPUnit assertions
fetch("https://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/assertions.html")
```

### 5. **Docker MCP** (Manage Environment)
- Start/stop test containers
- Reset test database
- View logs
- Debug issues

### 6. **Context7 Library MCP** (Up-to-date Docs)
```bash
# Get CakePHP 5.x docs
resolve-library-id --libraryName "cakephp"
get-library-docs --context7CompatibleLibraryID "/cakephp/cakephp/5.x"
```

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Daily Workflow
```bash
# Morning
./tools/testing/progress.sh --detailed

# During
./tools/testing/continuous-test.sh --model [Name] --watch

# Evening
./tools/testing/continuous-test.sh --model [Name] --coverage
git commit -m "test: Add [Name] tests (XX% coverage)"
```

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write test first
- See it fail (red)
- Write minimal code to pass (green)
- Refactor (blue)
- Repeat

### 3. Coverage-Driven
- Generate coverage after each component
- Focus on red areas
- Don't chase 100% blindly
- Focus on critical paths

### 4. Track Progress
- Use GitHub issues for each component
- Update Knowledge Graph MCP
- Commit frequently
- Review weekly progress

### 5. Use Watch Mode
- Faster feedback
- Instant results
- More productive
- Better focus

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Container Not Running
```bash
./run_dev_env.sh
```

### Test Database Missing
```bash
docker compose exec willowcms php bin/cake migrations migrate --connection=test
```

### Watch Mode Not Working
```bash
brew install fswatch
```

### Tests Fail After Generation
This is normal! Bake generates basic stubs. You need to:
1. Examine the model/controller
2. Write actual test assertions
3. Add test data (fixtures)
4. Test edge cases
