# Docker Compose Cloud Improvements

**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**File:** `docker-compose-cloud.yml`  
**Based On:** Working Nextcloud production configuration  

---

## Summary

The `docker-compose-cloud.yml` file has been updated with production-ready best practices based on a proven Nextcloud deployment configuration. These improvements enhance reliability, security, and maintainability.

---

## 🔧 Key Improvements Applied

### 1. **Container Naming & Hostnames**

**What Changed:**
- Added explicit `container_name` to all services
- Added `hostname` to all services for better DNS resolution

**Why:**
```yaml
# Before
services:
  willowcms:
    image: whatismyadapter:latest

# After
services:
  willowcms:
    container_name: WhatIsMyAdapter-App
    hostname: whatismyadapter-app
```

**Benefits:**
- Easier to identify containers in logs and monitoring
- Consistent naming across all deployments
- Better DNS resolution within Docker network
- Clearer output from `docker ps` commands

---

### 2. **Security Hardening**

**What Changed:**
- Added `security_opt: - no-new-privileges:true` to MySQL and main app containers
- Prevents privilege escalation attacks

**Why:**
```yaml
# Added security option
mysql:
  security_opt:
    - no-new-privileges:true
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents containers from gaining additional privileges
- Reduces attack surface
- Industry best practice for production deployments
- Aligns with Docker security benchmarks

---

### 3. **Health Checks for All Services**

**What Changed:**
- Added health checks to **all** services (willowcms, mysql, redis, phpmyadmin, mailpit, redis-commander)
- Added `start_period` to give services time to initialize

**Why:**
```yaml
# Before (redis only had health check)
redis:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "redis-cli ping"]

# After (all services have health checks)
willowcms:
  healthcheck:
    test: curl -f http://localhost:80/ || exit 1
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
    start_period: 40s

mysql:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost", "-u", "root", "-p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 5
    start_period: 60s
```

**Benefits:**
- Portainer/Docker can accurately report service status
- Automatic restart of unhealthy containers
- Better dependency management with `condition: service_healthy`
- Prevents cascading failures
- Faster failure detection

---

### 4. **Smart Dependency Management**

**What Changed:**
- Updated `depends_on` to use `condition: service_healthy` and `condition: service_started`
- Services now wait for dependencies to be truly ready, not just started

**Why:**
```yaml
# Before (basic dependency)
willowcms:
  depends_on:
    - mysql
    - redis

# After (smart dependency with health checks)
willowcms:
  depends_on:
    mysql:
      condition: service_started
    redis:
      condition: service_healthy

phpmyadmin:
  depends_on:
    mysql:
      condition: service_healthy
```

**Benefits:**
- App container waits for MySQL to be ready before starting
- Eliminates "connection refused" errors on startup
- More reliable deployment with no manual intervention
- Graceful startup order automatically enforced

---

### 5. **Restart Policies**

**What Changed:**
- Added `restart: on-failure:N` to all services
- Different retry counts based on service criticality

**Why:**
```yaml
# Specific restart policies per service
willowcms:
  restart: on-failure:5  # Application - 5 retries

redis:
  restart: on-failure:10  # Cache - 10 retries

mysql:
  restart: on-failure:15  # Database - 15 retries (most critical)

phpmyadmin:
  restart: on-failure:5   # Management UI - 5 retries
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic recovery from transient failures
- Prevents infinite restart loops
- More resilient to network hiccups during startup
- Database gets more retry attempts (most critical service)

---

### 6. **Environment Variable Format**

**What Changed:**
- Changed from `- ENV_VAR=value` to `ENV_VAR: value` format
- More readable and standard YAML format

**Why:**
```yaml
# Before (list format)
environment:
  - APP_NAME=${APP_NAME}
  - DEBUG=${DEBUG}

# After (mapping format)
environment:
  APP_NAME: ${APP_NAME}
  DEBUG: ${DEBUG}
```

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner, more readable syntax
- Standard Docker Compose format
- Easier to maintain and update
- Better IDE support for YAML validation

---

### 7. **MySQL Enhancements**

**What Changed:**
- Added `--transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED` and `--binlog-format=ROW`
- Added volume for MySQL configuration files
- Added health check with mysqladmin

**Why:**
```yaml
mysql:
  volumes:
    - /volume1/docker/whatismyadapter/mysql:/var/lib/mysql:rw
    - /volume1/docker/whatismyadapter/mysql-config:/etc/mysql/conf.d:rw  # NEW
  command: >
    --transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED  # NEW
    --binlog-format=ROW  # NEW
```

**Benefits:**
- Better consistency for concurrent transactions
- Proper binary logging for replication
- Ability to add custom MySQL configuration files
- More production-ready database setup

---

### 8. **Redis Health Check Improvement**

**What Changed:**
- Updated Redis health check to properly handle password
- Added `start_period` for initialization time

**Why:**
```yaml
# Before
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "redis-cli -a \"$REDIS_PASSWORD\" ping | grep PONG"]

# After
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "redis-cli -a \"${REDIS_PASSWORD}\" ping | grep PONG"]
  start_period: 10s  # NEW
```

**Benefits:**
- More reliable health check with proper password quoting
- Prevents false failures during startup
- Consistent with other service health checks

## 🚀 Deployment Impact

### Startup Behavior

**Before:**
1. All services start simultaneously
2. App might fail if MySQL/Redis not ready
3. Manual intervention needed for timing issues
4. No automatic recovery

**After:**
1. MySQL starts first (no dependencies)
2. Redis starts first (no dependencies)
3. Both become healthy before app starts
4. App starts with dependencies ready
5. Management UIs wait for their services
6. Automatic retry on transient failures

### Failure Recovery

**Before:**
```
MySQL fails → App crashes → Manual restart needed
```

**After:**
```
MySQL fails → Automatic retry (up to 15 times)
            → Health check fails → Container restarts
            → App waits for healthy MySQL → Recovers automatically
```

## 📁 Required Directory Structure

Ensure these directories exist on your cloud server:

```bash
/volume1/docker/whatismyadapter/
├── app/                 # Application code
├── logs/               # Application logs
├── nginx-logs/         # Nginx logs
├── tmp/                # Temporary files
├── mysql/              # MySQL data
├── mysql-config/       # NEW: MySQL configuration files
├── redis/              # Redis data
└── mailpit/            # Mailpit data
```

**Create the new directory:**
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /volume1/docker/whatismyadapter/mysql-config
sudo chown -R 1034:100 /volume1/docker/whatismyadapter/mysql-config
sudo chmod 755 /volume1/docker/whatismyadapter/mysql-config
```

---

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

1. **Faster Startup:** Services wait for dependencies to be truly ready
2. **Less Resource Waste:** No repeated connection attempts during startup
3. **Better Stability:** Automatic recovery from transient failures
4. **Clearer Monitoring:** Health status visible in Portainer
5. **Reduced Manual Intervention:** Self-healing on failures

---

## 🧪 Testing the Configuration

### 1. Validate Syntax

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-cloud.yml config
```

### 2. Test Health Checks Locally

```bash
# Start services
docker compose -f docker-compose-cloud.yml up -d

# Watch health status
watch docker ps

# Check specific service health
docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' WhatIsMyAdapter-App
```

### 3. Test Failure Recovery

```bash
# Kill MySQL to test restart policy
docker kill WhatIsMyAdapter-DB

# Watch automatic recovery
docker logs WhatIsMyAdapter-DB --follow
```

---

## 🔄 Migration from Old Configuration

If you have an existing deployment:

1. **Backup first:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-cloud.yml down
   # Backup volumes
   ```

2. **Update stack.env.cloud** (if needed)

3. **Deploy new configuration:**
   - In Portainer, update stack
   - Paste new docker-compose-cloud.yml
   - Load stack.env.cloud
   - Deploy

4. **Monitor startup:**
   - Watch container logs in Portainer
   - Verify all services become healthy
   - Test application access
