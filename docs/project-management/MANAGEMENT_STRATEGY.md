- **Automated testing** ensures reliability
- **Security practices** are embedded in workflows
- **Performance monitoring** is proactive, not reactive

## 📁 Organizational Structure Management

### **Core Principles:**

#### **1. Domain-Driven Directory Structure**
```
willow/
├── app/                    # Application domain
├── infrastructure/         # Infrastructure domain  
├── deploy/                 # Deployment domain
├── docs/                   # Documentation domain
├── tools/                  # Development domain
├── storage/                # Data domain
└── assets/                 # Presentation domain
```

#### **2. Consistent Naming Conventions**
- **Directories**: lowercase with hyphens (`storage/app-data/`)
- **Files**: PascalCase for classes, lowercase for configs
- **Variables**: camelCase in PHP, snake_case in configs
- **Database**: snake_case for tables and columns

#### **3. Environment Management**
```
app/config/environments/
├── .env.local              # Local development
├── .env.staging            # Staging environment  
├── .env.production         # Production environment
└── .env.testing            # Testing environment
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow Management

### **Daily Development Cycle:**

```bash
# 1. Start your development day
make start                  # Spin up all services
make status                 # Verify everything is running

# 2. Development work
make test                   # Run tests before changes
# ... make your changes ...
make test                   # Verify changes don't break anything
make quality               # Check code quality

# 3. End of day
make backup                # Create backup if significant changes
make stop                  # Clean shutdown
```

### **Feature Development Workflow:**

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-feature

# 2. Document the feature first
# Edit docs/features/amazing-new-feature.md

# 3. Write tests
# Create tests in app/tests/TestCase/

# 4. Implement feature
# Add code in appropriate app/src/ directories

# 5. Quality assurance
make test                  # All tests pass
make quality              # Code meets standards
make security             # Security checks pass

# 6. Integration
git push origin feature/amazing-new-feature
# Create Pull Request with:
# - Feature documentation
# - Test results
# - Quality metrics
```

### **Release Management:**

#### **Version Strategy: Semantic Versioning**
- **Major** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, major features
- **Minor** (x.y.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch** (x.y.z): Bug fixes, security patches

#### **Release Checklist:**
```bash
# Pre-release validation
make test-all              # Full test suite
make quality-check         # Comprehensive quality audit
make security-scan         # Security vulnerability check
make performance-test      # Performance benchmarks

# Documentation updates
# Update CHANGELOG.md
# Update API documentation
# Update deployment guides

# Release deployment
make backup-production     # Backup before deployment
make deploy-staging        # Deploy to staging first
make validate-staging      # Validate staging deployment
make deploy-production     # Deploy to production
make validate-production   # Post-deployment validation
```
