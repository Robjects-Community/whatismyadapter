# 🛠️ Tools Directory Organization

## Overview
The WillowCMS tools directory has been reorganized into logical subdirectories based on script dependencies and purposes. This improves maintainability, reduces clutter, and makes it easier to find the right tool for specific tasks.

## 📁 New Directory Structure

```
tools/
├── development/        # Development environment scripts
│   ├── manage.sh                 # Main management interface
│   ├── run_dev_env.sh           # Development environment setup
│   └── setup_dev_aliases.sh    # Development aliases and shortcuts
├── deployment/        # Deployment and infrastructure scripts
│   ├── reorganize_willow.sh         # Basic repository reorganization
│   └── reorganize_willow_secure.sh  # Security-focused reorganization
├── security/         # Security and verification tools
│   └── quick_security_check.sh     # Repository security verification
├── maintenance/      # File management and cleanup utilities
│   ├── refactor_helper_files.sh    # File refactoring wrapper
│   └── scripts/                     # Maintenance automation scripts
│       ├── cleanup.sh
│       ├── docker_compose_wrapper.sh
│       ├── health_check.sh
│       ├── restart_environment.sh
│       └── validate_environment.sh
└── legacy-helpers/   # Legacy compatibility scripts
    └── refactor_helper_files.sh.legacy
```

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

All main scripts remain accessible from the root directory through compatibility wrappers:

### Root Directory Wrappers
- **`./manage.sh`** → `tools/development/manage.sh`
- **`./run_dev_env.sh`** → `tools/development/run_dev_env.sh`
- **`./setup_dev_aliases.sh`** → `tools/development/setup_dev_aliases.sh`
- **`./reorganize_willow.sh`** → `tools/deployment/reorganize_willow.sh`
- **`./reorganize_willow_secure.sh`** → `tools/deployment/reorganize_willow_secure.sh`

The wrappers provide informational messages and forward all arguments to the actual scripts.

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Development Tasks
```bash
# Main management interface (both work)
./manage.sh                           # Via compatibility wrapper
tools/development/manage.sh           # Direct access

# Development environment setup
./run_dev_env.sh --fresh-dev          # Via compatibility wrapper
tools/development/run_dev_env.sh      # Direct access

# Development aliases setup
./setup_dev_aliases.sh                # Via compatibility wrapper
tools/development/setup_dev_aliases.sh # Direct access
```

### Security & Verification
```bash
# Security verification (updated location)
tools/security/quick_security_check.sh

# Run before commits to verify no sensitive data
tools/security/quick_security_check.sh --verbose
```

### Deployment & Infrastructure
```bash
# Basic repository reorganization
./reorganize_willow.sh                # Via compatibility wrapper
tools/deployment/reorganize_willow.sh # Direct access

# Security-focused reorganization
./reorganize_willow_secure.sh         # Via compatibility wrapper
tools/deployment/reorganize_willow_secure.sh # Direct access
```

### Maintenance & Cleanup
```bash
# File management (moved from root)
tools/maintenance/refactor_helper_files.sh

# Maintenance scripts
tools/maintenance/scripts/cleanup.sh
tools/maintenance/scripts/health_check.sh
tools/maintenance/scripts/restart_environment.sh
```

## 📋 Benefits of New Organization

### 1. **Clear Categorization**
- Scripts are grouped by their primary function and dependencies
- Easier to find the right tool for specific tasks
- Improved project maintainability

### 2. **Reduced Root Clutter**
- Main project directory is cleaner
- Essential files are more visible
- Professional project appearance

### 3. **Better Dependency Management**
- Development scripts are together
- Security tools are isolated
- Deployment scripts are centralized

### 4. **Enhanced Security**
- Security tools have their own dedicated directory
- Clear separation of security-related functionality
- Easier to audit security tools

### 5. **Improved Discoverability**
- Related tools are co-located
- Logical grouping makes finding tools intuitive
- Better documentation organization

## 🔧 For Developers

### New Script Location Guidelines

When creating new scripts:

1. **Development scripts** → `tools/development/`
   - Environment setup, debugging, local development
   
2. **Security scripts** → `tools/security/`
   - Security checks, vulnerability scanning, verification

3. **Deployment scripts** → `tools/deployment/`
   - Infrastructure, reorganization, production setup

4. **Maintenance scripts** → `tools/maintenance/`
   - Cleanup, refactoring, housekeeping tasks

### Script Dependencies

Each subdirectory can have its own dependencies:

- **development/**: Requires Docker, PHP, development environment
- **security/**: Minimal dependencies, focused on verification
- **deployment/**: May require production credentials, infrastructure access
- **maintenance/**: File system operations, cleanup utilities

## 🚀 Migration Complete

### What Changed
- ✅ All root scripts moved to appropriate subdirectories
- ✅ Compatibility wrappers created for seamless transition
- ✅ Documentation updated with new locations
- ✅ All functionality preserved

### What Stayed the Same
- ✅ All commands still work from root directory
- ✅ No changes to script functionality
- ✅ Same arguments and options supported
- ✅ Existing workflows remain compatible
