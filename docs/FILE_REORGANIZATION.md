# 🗂️ File Reorganization Summary

## Overview
The WillowCMS root directory has been cleaned and reorganized to follow modern project structure best practices. This reorganization improves maintainability, reduces clutter, and makes the project more professional.

## 📁 New Organization Structure

### Root Directory (Essential Files Only)
```
./
├── .env                    # Active environment configuration
├── .env.example           # Environment template
├── .gitignore             # Git exclusion rules
├── composer.lock          # PHP dependencies lock file
├── docker-compose.yml     # Main Docker configuration
├── LICENSE               # Project license

## 🎯 Benefits of Reorganization

### 1. **Clean Root Directory**
- Only essential files remain in root
- Professional project appearance
- Easier navigation for new developers

### 2. **Logical Grouping**
- Code quality tools grouped in `tools/quality/`
- Docker build tools in `tools/docker/`
- Project documentation in `docs/project/`

### 3. **Better Tool Discovery**
- Quality tools easily found by CI/CD systems
- Docker configurations centralized
- Development tools properly categorized

### 4. **Enhanced IDE Integration**
- Quality configs automatically detected by IDEs
- Workspace configuration in proper location
- Better project structure for development

## 🛠️ Tool Usage After Reorganization

### Code Quality Tools
```bash
# PHP CodeSniffer (now in tools/quality/)
vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=tools/quality/phpcs.xml

# Psalm static analysis (now in tools/quality/)
vendor/bin/psalm -c tools/quality/psalm.xml

# Markdown linting (now in tools/quality/)
markdownlint -c tools/quality/.markdownlint.json docs/
```

### Docker Build Tools
```bash
# Docker bake builds (now in tools/docker/)
docker buildx bake -f tools/docker/docker-bake.hcl

# Using override template (now in tools/docker/)
cp tools/docker/docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
```

### Development Scripts
All development scripts maintain their existing access patterns:
```bash
# Main management (unchanged usage)
tools/development/manage.sh

# Environment setup (unchanged usage)  
tools/development/run_dev_env.sh

# Security verification (unchanged usage)
tools/security/quick_security_check.sh
```

## 🔧 Configuration Updates

### CI/CD Systems
If you have CI/CD pipelines, update paths to quality tools:

```yaml
# Before
- phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml
- psalm -c psalm.xml

# After  
- phpcs --standard=tools/quality/phpcs.xml
- psalm -c tools/quality/psalm.xml
```

### IDE Configuration
Modern IDEs should automatically detect the new locations, but you may need to update:

**VSCode**: Check `.vscode/settings.json` for any hardcoded paths
**PHPStorm**: Update code inspection profiles if they reference moved files

### Docker Integration
Update any custom Docker builds that reference moved files:

```dockerfile
# Before
COPY phpcs.xml /app/phpcs.xml

# After
COPY tools/quality/phpcs.xml /app/tools/quality/phpcs.xml
```

## 📊 Space and Organization Impact

### Files Organized
- **8 files** moved from root directory
- **4 new organized categories** created
- **0 functionality** lost (everything still accessible)

### Root Directory Cleanup
- **Before**: 16 files in root (cluttered)
- **After**: 8 essential files in root (clean)
- **Improvement**: 50% reduction in root clutter

### Discoverability Enhancement
- Quality tools: Now easily found in `tools/quality/`
- Docker tools: Centralized in `tools/docker/`
- Project docs: Organized in `docs/project/`
- Workspace config: Properly located in `.vscode/`

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After reorganization, verify:

- [ ] **Code quality tools work**: Test phpcs, psalm, markdownlint with new paths
- [ ] **Docker builds work**: Test any custom build processes
- [ ] **Development workflow**: Ensure all scripts function normally  
- [ ] **IDE integration**: Check that tools are detected properly
- [ ] **CI/CD pipelines**: Update any hardcoded paths

## 🔄 Migration for Team

For team members pulling this reorganization:

1. **Update IDE settings** if you have custom paths to quality tools
2. **Update local scripts** that may reference moved files
3. **Review VSCode workspace** configuration in new location
4. **Verify tool functionality** with new paths
