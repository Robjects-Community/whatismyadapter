# WillowCMS Repository Reorganization - Implementation Checklist

## 🎯 Quick Start (30 minutes)

Ready to transform your WillowCMS into a beautifully organized, professional repository? Follow these steps:

### ✅ **Step 1: Safety First (5 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Commit any pending changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Pre-reorganization commit"

# 2. Create a backup branch
git checkout -b backup-before-reorganization
git checkout main  # or your main branch

# 3. Verify your environment works
docker-compose ps
```

### ✅ **Step 2: Run the Secure Reorganization Script (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Execute the secure automated reorganization with data cleansing
./reorganize_willow_secure.sh

# The script will:
# - Create a full backup (willow-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz)
# - CLEANSE all sensitive data files (*.sql, *.dump, backups)
# - Move sensitive files to secure backup location
# - Reorganize all directories into the new structure  
# - Update file paths in configurations
# - Create comprehensive .gitignore to prevent data leaks
# - Create essential management files (Makefile, README.md, etc.)
# - Run security verification checks
```

### ✅ **Step 3: Verify the New Structure (5 minutes)**
```bash
# Check the new directory structure
tree -L 2 .

# Should show:
# ├── app/                    # Main CakePHP application
# ├── infrastructure/         # Docker configs
# ├── deploy/                 # Deployment files
# ├── docs/                   # Documentation
# ├── tools/                  # Development tools
# ├── storage/                # File storage
# ├── assets/                 # Static assets
# ├── Makefile               # Development commands
# └── README.md              # Project overview
```

### ✅ **Step 4: Test Everything Works & Verify Security (10 minutes)**
```bash
# Test the application still works
make start          # Start services
make status         # Verify services are running
make security-check # CRITICAL: Verify no sensitive data in git
make test           # Run tests (may have some failures due to auth issues)
make stop           # Stop services when done

# If you encounter issues, you can restore from backup:
# tar -xzf willow-backup-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz --overwrite
```

## 🛠️ **New Development Commands**

After reorganization, use these commands for daily development:

```bash
make help           # Show all available commands
make start          # Start development environment
make stop           # Stop development environment
make test           # Run tests
make quality        # Check code quality
make backup         # Create secure database backup
make logs           # View application logs
make status         # Show service status
make security-check # 🔐 VERIFY no sensitive data in git
```

## 📁 **What Changed - Directory Mapping**

| **Before** | **After** | **Purpose** |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `cakephp/` | `app/` | Main application code |
| `docker/` | `infrastructure/docker/` | Docker configurations |
| `docker-compose*.yml` | `deploy/` | Deployment configs |
| `*.md` files | `docs/` | Documentation |
| `logs/` | `app/logs/` | Application logs |
| `.env*` | `app/config/environments/` | Environment configs |
| `setup_dev_aliases.sh` | `tools/scripts/` | Development scripts |
| `phpcs.xml` | `tools/quality/` | Code quality configs |
| `project_*_backups/` | `storage/backups/` | Backup storage |
| `default_data/` | `storage/seeds/` | Database seed data |
| `helper-files(...)` | `tools/legacy-helpers/` | Legacy helper files |

## 🔐 **Security & Data Cleansing Results**

The secure reorganization script has:

✅ **Cleansed sensitive data files:**
- All `*.sql`, `*.dump`, `*.backup` files moved to secure backup
- `./default_data/*` directory cleaned of real data
- Project backup directories relocated to `storage/backups/`
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` created to prevent future data leaks

✅ **Security measures implemented:**
- Sensitive files backed up in: `storage/backups/data-cleanse/`
- Git index cleaned of any sensitive content
- Environment templates created (no secrets committed)
- Security check script added: `make security-check`

## 🔧 **Configuration Updates Needed**

The script automatically updates most paths, but you may need to manually update:

### **1. Environment Files**
```bash
# Edit your environment file (template created for you)
vim app/config/environments/.env.local

# Configure your database, email, and security settings
# The template includes all necessary variables
```

### **2. IDE/Editor Settings**
If you use an IDE, update project settings:
- **VS Code**: Update `.vscode/settings.json` paths
- **PhpStorm**: Update project root and source paths
- **Sublime/Atom**: Update project file paths

### **3. CI/CD Pipelines**
Update your GitHub Actions or other CI/CD configs:
```yaml
# .github/workflows/*.yml
# Update paths from 'cakephp/' to 'app/'
working-directory: ./app
```

## 📝 **Next Steps After Reorganization**

### **Immediate (Today):**
1. **Run security check** - `make security-check` to verify no sensitive data in git
2. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure application works correctly
3. **Update team documentation** - Inform team about new structure and security measures
4. **Commit changes** - `git add -A && git commit -m "Secure repository reorganization with data cleansing"`
5. **Update deployment scripts** - If you have custom deployment scripts

### **This Week:**
1. **Security training** - Ensure team understands new security measures and `make security-check`
2. **Implement controller refactoring** using the external context provided
3. **Setup automated quality checks** - Configure PHPStan, PHPCS properly
4. **Enhance documentation** - Fill in the created documentation templates
5. **Team training** - Show team members new `make` commands and security workflow

### **This Month:**
1. **Performance monitoring** - Setup application performance tracking
2. **Security hardening** - Implement security scanning automation
3. **Backup verification** - Test restore procedures
4. **Technical debt** - Address any issues identified during reorganization

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Issue: "docker-compose command not found"**
```bash
# If using Docker Compose v2
sed -i 's/docker-compose/docker compose/g' Makefile
```

### **Issue: "Permission denied" errors**
```bash
# Fix file permissions
chmod +x tools/scripts/*.sh
chmod 755 app/logs app/tmp
```

### **Issue: "Database connection failed"**
```bash
# Verify environment configuration
cat app/config/environments/.env.local | grep DB_
make start
docker logs willow_mysql_1
```

### **Issue: "Tests are failing"**
```bash
# This is expected initially due to path changes
# Update test configuration files:
vim app/phpunit.xml
# Update any hardcoded paths
```

### **Issue: "Can't find files at old paths"**
```bash
# Use the mapping table above to find where files moved
# Or search for them:
find . -name "filename" -type f
```

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you encounter issues during reorganization:

1. **Check the backup** - You have a complete backup file created
2. **Review logs** - Check `make logs` for error messages
3. **Verify structure** - Compare against the structure in REPOSITORY_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md
4. **Test incrementally** - Use `make status` to check individual services
