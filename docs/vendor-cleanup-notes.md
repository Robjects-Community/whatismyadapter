# Vendor Directory Cleanup - Complete

## Overview
The `app/vendor` directory cleanup has been successfully completed. All Composer vendor files have been removed from Git tracking while preserving them on disk for the application to function.

## What Was Done

### 1. Branch Creation
- Created safety branch: `chore/vendor-cleanup`
- All changes made on this branch for easy rollback if needed

### 2. Git Ignore Update
- Updated `.gitignore` to properly exclude `/app/vendor/*`
- Preserved `.gitkeep` file to maintain directory structure
- Removed outdated `/cakephp/vendor/*` rule

### 3. File Management
- **Untracked**: 8,383 vendor files from Git index
- **Reverted**: All local modifications to vendor files using `git restore`
- **Preserved**: All vendor files remain on disk - application still functional
- **Added**: `.gitkeep` file to maintain directory structure

### 4. Git LFS Cleanup
- Untracked all `app/vendor/*` files from Git LFS
- Prevents future LFS tracking of vendor files

## Verification Results ✅

### Git Status
```bash
$ git ls-files app/vendor
app/vendor/.gitkeep  # Only file tracked

$ git status app/vendor
# Clean - no modifications

$ git check-ignore -v app/vendor/test-file
.gitignore:5421:/app/vendor/*	app/vendor/test-file  # Properly ignored
```

### Composer Validation
```bash
$ composer validate --no-check-publish
./composer.json is valid

$ composer install --dry-run --ignore-platform-reqs
Nothing to install, update or remove  # Dependencies satisfied
```

## Next Steps for Developers

### For Local Development
```bash
# If vendor directory becomes corrupted or missing dependencies
cd app
composer install

# For production deployment without dev dependencies
cd app
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

### For CI/CD Pipeline
Ensure your CI configuration includes:
```yaml
# Example for Docker/GitHub Actions
- name: Install Composer Dependencies
  run: |
    cd app
    composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-interaction
```

### For Docker Containers
The existing Docker setup should handle this automatically, but verify your Dockerfile includes:
```dockerfile
# In your PHP container Dockerfile
WORKDIR /var/www/html/app
COPY composer.json composer.lock ./
RUN composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-cache
```

## Repository Impact

### Storage Reduction
- **Before**: 8,383+ vendor files tracked in Git
- **After**: 1 `.gitkeep` file tracked
- **Disk Space**: Vendor files remain on disk for functionality
- **History**: Past commits still contain vendor files (consider `git filter-branch` for complete cleanup)

### Best Practices Compliance
- ✅ Composer vendor directory properly ignored
- ✅ Dependencies managed via `composer.json`/`composer.lock`
- ✅ Clean separation of source code and dependencies
- ✅ Faster git operations (clone, pull, diff)
- ✅ Reduced repository size for new clones

## Troubleshooting

### If Dependencies Are Missing
```bash
cd app
composer install
```

### If Platform Extensions Are Missing (Redis, etc.)
```bash
# For local development
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs

# For production, ensure extensions are installed:
# - ext-redis
# - ext-intl
# - ext-mbstring
# - etc.
```

### If You Need to Rollback
```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D chore/vendor-cleanup
# Vendor files will need to be restored manually if this cleanup is undone
```

## Integration Notes

This cleanup is compatible with:
- ✅ Existing Docker Compose setup
- ✅ CakePHP 5.x framework requirements  
- ✅ Current development workflow
- ✅ Backup scripts in `./tools/backup/`
- ✅ Deployment processes
