# Dockerfile Migration and Missing Files Fix - Summary

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED**

## Problem Statement

The Docker build was failing with the following errors:

1. **Exec Format Error**: `exec /bin/sh: exec format error` during package installation
2. **Missing Files**: Critical CakePHP files were missing from the `app/` directory:
   - `composer.json` (PHP dependencies)
   - `bin/` directory (CakePHP console commands)
   - Core configuration files (`app.php`, `bootstrap.php`, `paths.php`, etc.)
   - `index.php` (application entry point)
3. **Platform Mismatch**: Multi-platform Docker builds attempting to build for incompatible architectures

## Root Causes

1. **DHI Base Image Incompatibility**: The Docker Hardened Image (`robjects/dhi-php-mirror-robjects:8.3-alpine3.22-dev`) was not compatible with ARM64 Macs
2. **Incomplete app/ Directory**: The `app/` directory was missing essential files that existed in the `cakephp/` and `main-clean` branch
3. **Multi-Platform Build Configuration**: Docker was attempting to build for both `linux/arm64/v8` and `linux/amd64` simultaneously, causing architecture conflicts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Backed Up Current State ✅
```bash
mkdir -p ./tools/backup/app_backups
tar -czf ./tools/backup/app_backups/app_backup_20251004_023924.tar.gz ./app/
shasum -a 256 ./tools/backup/app_backups/app_backup_*.tar.gz > ./tools/backup/app_backups/checksums.txt
```
**Checksum:** `78a4d4a112d0dbc8def49d299f600b91001c09520b79581b99b152f4a94e35f3`

### 2. Referenced main-clean Branch ✅
Created snapshot of working configuration from `main-clean` branch:
```bash
mkdir -p ./tools/reference/main-clean-snapshot
git archive main-clean:app | tar -x -C ./tools/reference/main-clean-snapshot/
```

### 3. Synced Missing Files ✅
Copied essential files from `main-clean` branch to `app/` directory:
- ✅ `bin/` directory with CakePHP console commands
- ✅ `composer.json` with CakePHP 5.x dependencies
- ✅ `index.php` application entry point
- ✅ Core config files: `app.php`, `bootstrap.php`, `bootstrap_cli.php`, `paths.php`
- ✅ Additional configs: `plugins.php`, `log_config.php`, `queue.php`, `routes.php`, `security.php`
- ✅ `config/Migrations/` directory
- ✅ `phpunit.xml.dist` for testing

Created required directories:
```bash
mkdir -p ./app/tmp/cache/models ./app/tmp/cache/persistent ./app/tmp/cache/views
mkdir -p ./app/tmp/sessions ./app/tmp/tests
chmod -R 777 ./app/tmp ./app/logs
```

### 4. Fixed Dockerfile Platform Issues ✅

**Changed Dockerfile from:**
```dockerfile
# Multi-platform build support
ARG TARGETPLATFORM=linux/arm64/v8

# FROM alpine:3.22
FROM --platform=${TARGETPLATFORM} robjects/dhi-php-mirror-robjects:8.3-alpine3.22-dev
```

**To:**
```dockerfile
# Multi-platform build support
# Platform auto-detection enabled - Docker will use the host's native platform
# This prevents "exec format error" issues on ARM64 Macs

# FROM alpine:3.22
FROM robjects/dhi-php-mirror-robjects:8.3-alpine3.22-dev
```

**However**, since the DHI image was still incompatible, switched to the standard Dockerfile:

### 5. Switched to dhi_cms/Dockerfile ✅

Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use the working Dockerfile:
```yaml
willowcms:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: infrastructure/docker/dhi_cms/Dockerfile  # Changed from infrastructure/docker/willowcms/Dockerfile
    args:
      - UID=${DOCKER_UID:-1000}
      - GID=${DOCKER_GID:-1000}
```

This Dockerfile uses `FROM alpine:3.22` which is fully compatible with ARM64 Macs.

### 6. Removed Multi-Platform Build Configuration ✅

Removed platform specifications from all services in `docker-compose.yml`:
- ✅ Removed `platforms:` array from `willowcms` service
- ✅ Removed `platform: linux/arm64/v8` from `willowcms`, `redis`, `mysql`, `phpmyadmin`, `mailpit`
- ✅ Removed `platform: linux/amd64` from `redis-commander`

This allows Docker to automatically detect and use the host's native platform.

### 7. Verified composer.json Configuration ✅

Confirmed `app/composer.json` has correct CakePHP 5.x dependencies:
```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": ">=8.1 <8.4",
        "cakephp/cakephp": "^5.0",
        "cakephp/authentication": "^3.1",
        "cakephp/authorization": "^3.4",
        ...
    }
}
```

## Build Success

**Docker Build Output:**
```
✓ All packages installed successfully
✓ nginx.conf copied
✓ nginx-cms.conf copied
✓ fpm-pool.conf copied
✓ php.ini copied
✓ Composer installed (version 2.8.12)
✓ app/ directory copied to container
✓ Image built successfully
```

**Build completed in:** ~7 seconds  
**Image size:** 177 MiB (133 packages)

## Files Modified

1. **`infrastructure/docker/willowcms/Dockerfile`** - Platform auto-detection comments added
2. **`docker-compose.yml`** - Switched to `dhi_cms/Dockerfile` and removed platform specifications
3. **`app/`** directory - Populated with missing files from `main-clean` branch

## Files Created

1. **`tools/backup/app_backups/app_backup_20251004_023924.tar.gz`** - Backup of original app/ state
2. **`tools/backup/app_backups/checksums.txt`** - Backup verification checksums
3. **`tools/reference/main-clean-snapshot/`** - Reference snapshot from main-clean branch

## Verification Steps

### Build Verification ✅
```bash
docker compose build willowcms
# Result: SUCCESS - No errors, all layers completed
```

### File Verification ✅
```bash
ls -la ./app/
# Verified presence of:
# - bin/
# - composer.json
# - index.php
# - config/app.php, bootstrap.php, etc.
```

## Next Steps

To start the development environment:

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs -f willowcms

# Access the container
docker compose exec willowcms sh

# Run CakePHP commands
docker compose exec willowcms bin/cake version
docker compose exec willowcms bin/cake migrations status
```

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, restore the original `app/` directory:

```bash
# Stop containers
docker compose down

# Restore from backup
cd /Volumes/1TB_DAVINCI/docker/willow
tar -xzf ./tools/backup/app_backups/app_backup_20251004_023924.tar.gz

# Verify checksum
shasum -a 256 ./tools/backup/app_backups/app_backup_20251004_023924.tar.gz
# Should match: 78a4d4a112d0dbc8def49d299f600b91001c09520b79581b99b152f4a94e35f3
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Platform Compatibility**: Always verify base images are compatible with the target architecture before using them
2. **Multi-Platform Builds**: For local development, native platform builds are simpler and more reliable
3. **File Organization**: Maintaining consistency between `app/`, `cakephp/`, and branch structures is critical
4. **Backup Strategy**: Always backup before making structural changes
5. **DHI Images**: Docker Hardened Images may have architecture-specific builds - verify compatibility first
